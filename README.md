# A Go implementation of a single-decree Paxos

## The purpose of this implementation of Paxos is to use it as a system under test for model-based testing with Coloured Petri Nets (CPNs)

## Main structure of the implementation of Paxos and test adapter:

### 1. reader folder has the code that can be used to reade test cases in XML format for testing the implementation.
### 2. xml/testcases folder has all test cases generated by CPNs tool which can be used to test the implementation,
### 3. under singlepaxos folder, there are the code of the implementation of Paxos and the code of the tester of the test adapter.

## RUN Tests:

### a. unit tests:

1. run shell script qfunitests.sh to perform all unit tests.
2. run shell script qfcoverage.sh to get statement coverage of unit tests. 

### b. system tests:

1. run shell script systemtest.sh to test the whole Paxos system.
2. run shell script systemcoverage.sh to test the whole Paxos system and get statement coverage results.

### All testing results will be generated under a results folder.
